# Doubly Linked List
This is a doubly linked list which has access to the head and tail pointers along with keeping track of size

You can add elements by node or value to either the front or back

# Doubly Node
This node is a doubly node, meaning it has access to its previous and next nodes.

You can set next and previous values by either passing in a node or the value you want in the node
